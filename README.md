# Tensorflow-Hello-World
This is a Deep Neural Network made using Tensorflow and Keras which has been trained to predict the answer to the equation Y=0.5X+0.5 it's a 4 layer network which after training for 500 epochs understands the equation itself and learns to predict the answer of Y.

* [Hello World.ipynb](https://github.com/Moddy2024/Tensorflow-Hello-World/blob/main/Hello%20World.ipynb) - In this file you can see the data has been created in a numpy array. The numpy array xs is the X part of the equation while the ys array is the final output. Both of these arrays are fed to the Neural network and then it is trained for 500 epochs after which we can see it has the accuracy of 99.33%.
